/**
 * The implementation of word matching - with word matching the field is assumed to contain a single "word" - some
 * contiguous sequence of word and number characters - but without changing the data at the indexing side (as with text
 * matching) to enforce this. Word matching is thus almost like exact matching on the indexing side (no action taken),
 * and like text matching on the query side. This may be suitable for attributes, where people both expect the data to
 * be left as in the input document, and trivially written queries to work by default. However, this may easily lead to
 * data which cannot be matched at all as the indexing and query side does not agree.
