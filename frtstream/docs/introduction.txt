FrtStream provides an iostream like interface to Frt. It consists of
two main parts: FrtClientStream and FrtServerStream. Both streams can
read/write integers, floating point numbers, strings(std), and
standard c++ containers containing these types. Other types can be
added by operator overloading.( like for iostreams )

FrtClientStream 
This is a complete abstraction for making simple Frt clients. 
It's used the following way:

FrtClientStream s(<connectionSpec>); 
s <<Method(<methodName>) <<param1 <<param2 ... <<paramN; 
s >> result1 >>result2 ... >>resultn

s <<Method(<methodName2>) ...



FrtServerStream 
This is currently only a wrapper to use around Request
objects on the server to ease working with parameters and return
values. It's used inside method handlers by making a FrtServerStream
on the stack and passing the request object to it's constructor:

FrtServerStream s(request);
s >>param1 >>param2 .... >>paramn
s <<return1 <<return2 ... <<returnn.
