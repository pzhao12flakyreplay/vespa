This is the source for a basic docker image that runs a python HTTP server listening at IPv6 port 80.
The server serves two basic paths:
    /ip     - returns IP address of the requester
    /ping   - returns string "pong"


To build the image run:
$ sudo docker build -t "simple-ipv6-server:Dockerfile" <path to this directory>
